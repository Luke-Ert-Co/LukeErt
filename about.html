          <p>
            Hi, I'm Luke. I'm a designer and student based in England. I
            specialize in creating grungy and interesting graphics and designs
            for businesses and individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently studying design and animation, where I am constantly
            learning and refining my skills in various areas of graphic design.
            From logo and branding design to print and digital media, I am
            always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect of design that particularly fascinates me is the power of
            storytelling through visuals. I believe that every design has the
            potential to convey a narrative and evoke emotions. Whether it's
            through the careful selection of colors, the arrangement of elements,
            or the integration of typography, I strive to create designs that not
            only catch the eye but also communicate a deeper message.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within my work I combine both physical and digital design via use of a
            photo scanner and a typewriter. Some of my work contains warped scanned
            pages of books or scanned items for use as a texture. I also am interested
            in film photography, with some of my photos being scanned and used within my 
            work, a roll of my film has been used to create the border of this website.
